-- select data that we want to check first
select location date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population 

from covid_death
-- we order this by date and total case i.e column 1 and 2
order by 1,2 

-- we look at total cases vs total deaths
--since we have specified total_cases and total_deaths as integer, we have to convert them to numeric
-- this is because, division of two interger, result is an integer, and resulting 0 is truncated, resulting int zero
select location date, total_cases, total_deaths,(total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from covid_death
order by 1,2 

-- to fix the zero in deathPercentage,we do the following, put ::numeric beofre the integer values
select location date, total_cases, total_deaths,(total_deaths::numeric/total_cases::numeric)*100 as DeathPercentage
from covid_death
order by 1,2 

-- to specify country

select

	total_cases,
